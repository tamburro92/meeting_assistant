# Gemini Code Assistant Workspace Context

## Project Overview

The "Meeting Assistant" is a desktop application designed to streamline the process of documenting meetings. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to record audio, transcribe the spoken content into text, and then generate a concise summary of the transcription. This tool is ideal for users who need to quickly capture the key points and decisions from a meeting without manually taking notes.

The application is architected with a clear separation of concerns, with distinct modules for audio recording, transcription, summarization, and the user interface. The transcription and summarization components are designed to be modular, currently using placeholder functions that can be easily replaced with actual API calls to services like Google Gemini, OpenAI, or other speech-to-text and summarization providers.

## Key Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3
- **GUI:** Tkinter (standard Python library)
- **Audio Processing:**
  - `sounddevice`: For capturing audio from the microphone.
  - `numpy` / `scipy`: For processing and saving the recorded audio into WAV file format.
- **Concurrency:** `threading` module is used to run the audio recording process in the background without freezing the GUI.

## File Breakdown

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point of the application. Its primary responsibility is to initialize the Tkinter root window and launch the graphical user interface.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Specifies the Python dependencies for the project.
- **`meeting_assistant/`**: The main source code directory.
    - **`__init__.py`**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
    - **`core/`**: Contains the core business logic of the application.
        - **`__init__.py`**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
        - **`recorder.py`**: Manages all audio recording functionality.
        - **`transcriber.py`**: Responsible for converting the recorded audio file into text.
        - **`summarizer.py`**: Responsible for condensing the transcribed text into a summary.
    - **`ui/`**: Contains the user interface code.
        - **`__init__.py`**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
        - **`gui.py`**: This file contains all the code related to the user interface.
- **`recordings/`**: This directory is the designated location for storing all the `.wav` audio files generated by the recorder.
- **`README.md`**: The standard project README file, containing a user-facing overview of the project, features, and setup instructions.

## Core Functionality & Application Flow

1.  **Launch**: The user starts the application by running `python main.py`.
2.  **GUI Initialization**: `main.py` calls `gui.py` to build and display the main application window.
3.  **Recording**:
    - The user clicks the "Start Recording" button.
    - The `gui.py` module calls `recorder.start_recording()`, which begins capturing audio in a background thread.
    - The user clicks the "Stop Recording" button.
    - The `gui.py` module calls `recorder.stop_recording()`, which saves the audio to a `.wav` file in the `recordings/` directory.
4.  **Transcription**:
    - The user clicks the "Transcribe" button.
    - The GUI retrieves the path to the most recently created audio file.
    - It calls `transcriber.transcribe_audio()` with the file path.
    - The returned text (currently a dummy string) is displayed in the "Transcription" text area.
5.  **Summarization**:
    - The user clicks the "Summarize" button.
    - The GUI takes the text from the "Transcription" area.
    - It calls `summarizer.summarize_text()` with this text.
    - The returned summary (currently a dummy string) is displayed in the "Summary" text area.

## Setup and Usage

To run the application, the user needs to have Python 3 installed along with the `sounddevice` library.

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
